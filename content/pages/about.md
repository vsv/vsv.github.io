My name is Vlad, and this is going to be my personal blog about Linux, JVM, distributed computing, and the universe. I also live in Poland while originally being from Ukraine, so occasionally I will write about that too.

Please take a look at my [Resume](@/pages/resume.md) if you would like to know more about my background.

Feel free to write me an e-mail (<mail@vsv.dev>) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladsv/).
