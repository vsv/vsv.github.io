Before 2005
-----------

It all started in 1993, when 5 years old me somehow persuaded my dad to buy me [a Soviet clone of ZX-Spectrum](https://oldcomputer.info/8bit/sintez/index.htm). It cost 30000 [Karbovantsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_karbovanets), which was almost the same as dad's monthly salary (also, it equaled [≈25 US Dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation)). A couple of years later, I started learning Sinclair Basic, and at age 10 I wrote a couple of silly games and something like a piano simulator.

In my first school, I learned some Turbo Pascal and enjoyed writing programs in my copybook, because neither I nor my school had a proper IBM PC yet. When I turned 14, I switched schools (the new one actually had computers in the informatics classroom) and my parents bought me a Celeron-based PC. From day one I had Windows 98 and Mandrake Linux installed there in dual-boot, and I spent most of my winter holidays writing "15 puzzle" game in Delphi. A couple of years later, when my HDD got partially damaged and I couldn't install Windows on it, I fully switched to Linux and started learning Python and Qt.

Despite the fact that I genuinely enjoyed programming, most of my computer enthusiasm came from the fact that there was absolutely nothing to do in [Luhansk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhansk), so after finishing school I moved to [Kharkiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv), which is a major university center and the 2nd largest city in Ukraine.

2005-2010: University of Radioelectronics, Kharkiv

_**(BSc, Computer Engineering; major: Systems Programming)**_

KNURE (which is short for Kharkiv National Uni of RadioElectronics) is considered to be the best CS/EE university in the area, and that's why most of the computer nerds from Eastern Ukraine end up there. I believe this is the main advantage of the "offline" universities over MOOCs and other "online" schools: you can meet other enthusiasts, grow some network, get acquainted with the potential employers and so on. Pretty soon I got bored with "Introduction to programming" courses, meet some people at the faculty, started attending the algorithms learning group. Eventually, this got me into a summer intership at Aldec (see below), which then became a part-time employment, and eventually – a full time job. At that time I was young and stupid, and considered working in the industry so much superior to the university studies; that's why even though I got admitted to Masters program free of charge after getting my BSc degree, I ended up dropping it eventually.

<!-- Aldec is a company which creates tools for the hardware designers. If you've ever heard such words as FPGA or ASIC, you might've also heard that instead of designing the microelectronics manuall

Aldec-Kharkiv was entirely based on KNURE. All the employees were either former or then-present students, and the head of our department [Sergey Zaychenko]
(I still play with my FPGA from [NAndLand](https://www.nandland.com) from time to time) -->

<!-- As for the outsourcing company

Still

I got lucky and became a team leader working on a "startup-like" project. It almost gave me an illusion – until 2020 pandemia
