TBD: Tell why it's not a resume

Before 2005

It all started in 1993, when a friend of my dad bought [a Soviet clone of ZX-Spectrum](https://oldcomputer.info/8bit/sintez/index.htm) to his nephew, and somehow I persuaded my dad to buy me one too (I was 5 years old at that time). It cost 30000 [Karbovantsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_karbovanets), which was almost the same as dad's monthly salary (also, it equaled [â‰ˆ25 US Dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation)). A couple of years later, I started learning Sinclair Basic, and at age 10 I wrote a couple of simple games and a kind of piano simulator.

In my first school, I learned some Turbo Pascal and enjoyed writing programs in my copybook, because neither I nor my school had a proper IBM PC yet. When I turned 14, I switched schools and my parents bought my Celeron-based PC. From day one I had Windows 98 and Mandrake Linux installed there in dual-boot, and I spent most of my winter holidays writing "15 puzzle" game in Delphi. A couple of years later, when my HDD got partially damaged and I couldn't install Windows on it, I fully switched to Linux and started learning Python and Qt.

Despite the fact that I genuinely enjoyed programming, most of my computer enthusiasm came from the fact that there was absolutely nothing to do in Luhansk _(a town in Eastern Ukraine, currently occupied by Russia),_ so after finishing school I moved to Kharkiv, which is a major university center and the 2nd largest city in Ukraine.
