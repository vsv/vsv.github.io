It cost 30000 <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_karbovanets>Karbovantsy</a>, which was almost the same as dad's monthly salary (also, it equaled <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation>≈25 US Dollars</a>). A couple of years later, I started learning Sinclair Basic, and at age 10 I wrote a couple of silly games and something like a piano simulator.<p>In my first school, I learned some Turbo Pascal and enjoyed writing programs in my copybook, because neither I nor my school had a proper IBM PC yet. When I turned 14, I switched schools (the new one actually had computers in the informatics classroom) and my parents bought me a Celeron-based PC. From day one I had Windows 98 and Mandrake Linux installed there in dual-boot, and I spent most of my winter holidays writing "15 puzzle" game in Delphi. A couple of years later, when my HDD got partially damaged and I couldn't install Windows on it, I fully switched to Linux and started learning Python and Qt.</p><img align=center height=400 src=/images/luhansk.png width=500><center><i>The city of Luhansk</i></center><p>Despite the fact that I genuinely enjoyed programming, most of my computer enthusiasm came from the fact that there was absolutely nothing to do in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhansk>Luhansk</a>, so after finishing school I moved to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv>Kharkiv</a>, which is a major university center and the 2nd largest city in Ukraine.<h2 id=2005-2010-university-of-radioelectronics-kharkiv>2005-2010: University of Radioelectronics, Kharkiv</h2><img align=center height=400 src=/images/knure.jpg width=500><center><i>KNURE</i></center><p><em><strong>(BSc, Computer Engineering; major: Systems Programming)</strong></em><p>KNURE (which is short for Kharkiv National Uni of RadioElectronics) is considered to be the best CS/EE university in the area, and that's why most of the computer nerds from Eastern Ukraine end up there. I believe this is the main advantage of the "offline" universities over MOOCs and other "online" schools: you can meet other enthusiasts, grow some network, get acquainted with the potential employers and so on. Pretty soon I got bored with "Introduction to programming" courses, meet some people at the faculty, started attending the algorithms learning group. Eventually, this got me into a summer intership at Aldec (see below), which then became a part-time employment, and eventually – a full time job. At that time I was young and stupid, and considered working in the industry so much superior to the university studies; that's why even though I got admitted to Masters program free of charge after getting my BSc degree, I ended up dropping it eventually.<h2 id=2006-2012-aldec>2006-2012: Aldec</h2><p>TBD<p>..<h2 id=2012-2014-globallogic>2012-2014: Globallogic</h2><p>TBD<h2 id=2014-2021-grid-dynamics>2014-2021: Grid Dynamics</h2><p>TBD<h2 id=2021-now-roq-ad>2021-now: Roq.ad</h2><p>TBD</div><div class=article-info><div class=article-taxonomies></div></div></article></main><footer><p>© 2023 Vlad Svitlychnyi<br> Powered by <a href=https://getzola.org/ target=_blank>Zola</a>, Theme <a href=https://github.com/zbrox/anpu-zola-theme target=_blank>Anpu</a>.<p></footer></div>
